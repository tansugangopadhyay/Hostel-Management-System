The Hostel Management System I developed in the C programming language serves as a comprehensive solution for efficiently managing hostel-related tasks and information. This system allows hostel administrators to maintain a centralized database containing details about residents, room allocations, and billing information. Through a user-friendly interface, administrators can easily add, modify, or delete student records, allocate rooms, and track payment statuses. The system incorporates features like attendance tracking, providing a comprehensive overview of resident activities. Additionally, it generates automated reports, helping administrators make informed decisions about room occupancy, billing, and overall hostel management. The use of C language ensures that the system is efficient, fast, and resource-effective, making it a practical and reliable tool for hostel administrators to streamline their daily operations.
